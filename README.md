This repository contains my custom configuration files (dotfiles) for Hyprland, a dynamic tiling window manager for Wayland, along with configurations for related tools like Waybar, kitty, fastfetch, and more. These dotfiles serve as my starting point for a minimal yet functional desktop environment.
