This repository contains my custom configuration files (dotfiles) for Hyprland, a dynamic tiling window manager for Wayland, along with configurations for related tools like Waybar, kitty, fastfetch, and more. These dotfiles are set up for my Arch Linux system and serve as my starting point for a simple yet functional desktop environment.
